## Overview:
Creating a story using Tableau and 2019 data to display the bike-sharing program in Des Moiines. 

For this analysis, we will be using Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, youâ€™ll create a set of visualizations to:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results:

1. Top Starting Locations: This map shows the top starting locations the users for the bike-sharing program prefers. The darker the shade and the larger the circles shows the more amount of users are preferring to start at these locations.
